This is the repository for the paper with title: A pragmatic methodology to evaluate the configuration for a double busbar substation in an electrical grid

Abstract— This paper addresses the optimization of double busbar substations with multiple fields to prevent overcurrents through the coupler and therefore enhance grid reliability. A matrix-based method is proposed to estimate current coupling, and real-life simulations are conducted on the Colombian bulk power system. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in identifying optimal configurations, ensuring secure and flexible operation. The study provides valuable insights into enhancing power grid stability and efficiency.

Keywords— data, fast calculation, historian, matrix, pragmatic, Python, substation
